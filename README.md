## Deep Linking

Deep linking is a technique that allows an app to be opened to a specific UI or state, using a URL. This is useful for a variety of reasons, such as driving user engagement from web to app, or simply providing a better user experience.

### Android Deep Linking

1. Create a `/src/.well-known` directory in your project's `src` directory.

2. Inside the `/src/.well-known` directory, create a file named `assetlinks.json`

3. In the `assestslinks.json` file, add the following code to it:

```json
[
  {
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "com.example.yourapp",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": ["14:6D:E9:..."]
    }
  }
]
```

Replace `com.example.yourapp` with your app's package name and replace `14:6D:E9:...` with the SHA-256 fingerprint of your app's signing certificate.

4. Add the `/src/.well-known` directory to the `assets` array in your `angular.json` file.

```json
"assets": [
  "src/favicon.ico",
  "src/assets",
  {
    "glob": "**/*",
    "input": "src/.well-known",
    "output": "/.well-known"
  }
]
```

5. Rebuild your project.

### iOS Universal Links

1. Create a `/src/.well-known` directory in your project's `src` directory.

2. Inside the `/src/.well-known` directory, create a file named `apple-app-site-association`

3. In the `apple-app-site-association` file, add the following code to it:

```json
{
  "applinks": {
    "apps": [],
    "details": [
      {
        "appID": "TEAM_ID.BUNDLE_ID",
        "paths": ["*"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `TEAM_ID.BUNDLE_ID` with your app's Team ID and Bundle ID.

4. Add the `/src/.well-known` directory to the `assets` array in your `angular.json` file.

```json
"assets": [
  "src/favicon.ico",
  "src/assets",
  {
    "glob": "**/*",
    "input": "src/.well-known",
    "output": "/.well-known"
  }
]
```

5. Rebuild your project.

After following these steps, your Angular app should be set up to handle deep links on both Android and iOS devices.

## Firebase Messaging Service Worker

In your project, you need to create a file named `src/firebase-messaging-sw.js`. This file will be responsible for handling Firebase messaging in the service worker.

Here's a breakdown of the code in this file:

```js
// Give the service worker access to Firebase Messaging.
// Note that you can only use Firebase Messaging here. Other Firebase libraries
// are not available in the service worker.
importScripts("https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.10.1/firebase-app.js");
importScripts("https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.10.1/firebase-messaging.js");

// Initialize the Firebase app in the service worker by passing in
// your app's Firebase config object.
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#config-object
const firebaseApp = initializeApp({
  apiKey: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  authDomain: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  projectId: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  storageBucket: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  messagingSenderId: "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  appId: "x:xxxxxxxxxxxx:web:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
});

// Retrieve an instance of Firebase Messaging so that it can handle background
// messages.
const messaging = firebase.messaging();
```

This code initializes your Firebase application with your Firebase configuration. Replace the "xxxxxxx" with your actual Firebase configuration values.

This line retrieves an instance of Firebase Messaging so that it can handle background messages.

## Security

### Paths

- `android/app/google-services.json`

- `ios/App/App/GoogleService-info.plist`

### Google Services

#### GoogleService-info.plist and google-services.json

`google-services.json` is a configuration file that contains information about a Firebase project, such as the project's API key, database URL, and storage bucket. It is used by Android apps to connect to Firebase services, such as Firebase Authentication, Firebase Realtime Database, and Firebase Cloud Messaging.

The content of the Firebase config or object can be considered as public, including the app's platform-specific ID (Apple bundle ID or Android package name) and the Firebase project-specific values, like the API Key, project ID, Realtime Database URL, and Cloud Storage bucket name. Given this, use Firebase Security Rules to protect your data and files in Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, and Cloud Storage.

`GoogleService-info.plist` is a configuration file that contains information about a Firebase project, such as the project's API key, database URL, and storage bucket. It is used by iOS apps to connect to Firebase services, such as Firebase Authentication, Firebase Realtime Database, and Firebase Cloud Messaging.

To secure the `GoogleService-info.plist` file, you can ensure that it is not publicly accessible. This can be done by adding the file to your app's .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed to your repository. Additionally, you can use Firebase Security Rules to restrict access to your Firebase project's resources, such as the Realtime Database and Cloud Storage, to only authorized users.

It is also important to keep your Firebase project's API key and other sensitive information secure. You can use a password manager to securely store your API key and other credentials, and avoid hardcoding them in your app's code.

For more information on how to secure your Firebase project, please refer to the following resources:

- [Config Files Objects](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more#config-files-objects)
